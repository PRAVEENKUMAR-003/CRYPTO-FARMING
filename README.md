Project Description

Problem statement:
Before the crop cycle starts, farmers pay an insurance payment, and anytime a loss occurs on
their farm, they receive a payout from the insurance. Farmers are able to manage their
financial exposure to weather extremes, i.e., financial losses brought on by weather extremes,
because the insurer is taking on all of the insured risk in this way. Additionally, the insurer can
further hedge the systemic element of the risk with a reinsurance business in case of weather
hazards that systematically affect all the covered farms.
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The fundamental facts and knowledge about the natural resources that underpin all types of
farming constitute the basis of the agri-food systems. It depicts the flow of data and information
as well as the flow of products from input to output through several phases of value addition as
well as the movement of money from output to input.Utilizing ICT, the internet of things (IoT),
and a variety of contemporary data gathering and analysis tools, such as unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAV), sensors, and machine learning, is a hallmark of cryptographic agriculture.
Traditional methods manage data in a centralised manner and are vulnerable to cyberattacks,
faulty data, data distortion, and misuse.It makes sure that all recorded data is unchangeable
and that the facts and information are transparent to the participants and interested
parties.Unlike previous systems, which rely on the "security of obscurity," blockchain
technology produces security through decentralisation.Our project demonstrates how different
blockchain configurations (permissioned or permissionless), platforms (Ethereum or
Hyperledger), and consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work/Proof of Stake and (Practical)
Byzantine Fault Tolerance) may be suitable for data collection at various stages in crop
agri-food systems.
ADVANTAGES OF OUR SOLUTION:
Importantly, collecting reliable data from major farmers rather than smallholders for upload to
the blockchain is better motivated. Large farmers are more likely to participate in and gain from
blockchain-based cryptographic agriculture. Thus, this may contribute to or exacerbate the gap
between large and small farmers.Peer-to-peer transactions can now be conducted
transparently and without the involvement of a middleman in the agriculture industry or a bank
(for bitcoins, for example). As a result of the technology's elimination of the requirement for a
central authority, trust is now granted to cryptography and peer-to-peer architecture rather than
an authority. As a result, it aids in rebuilding consumer and producer trust, which can lower the
cost of transactions in the agri-food industry.
